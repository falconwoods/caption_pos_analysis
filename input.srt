1
00:00:06,961 --> 00:00:11,382
In 2018, an orca called Tahlequah gave birth.

2
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:14,426
But her daughter died within an hour.

3
00:00:14,593 --> 00:00:18,137
Tahlequah, however, didn’t leave her body.

4
00:00:18,347 --> 00:00:24,561
And over the next 17 days and 1,600 kilometers,

5
00:00:24,687 --> 00:00:27,647
she kept it afloat atop her own,

6
00:00:27,774 --> 00:00:31,318
diving to retrieve the body whenever it slipped away,

7
00:00:31,486 --> 00:00:34,280
even after it began deteriorating.

8
00:00:34,947 --> 00:00:37,784
By altering her feeding and travel patterns,

9
00:00:37,825 --> 00:00:41,454
Tahlequah’s behavior was certainly unusual.

10
00:00:41,996 --> 00:00:44,915
But was she mourning— or just confused?

11
00:00:45,082 --> 00:00:47,833
Do non-human animals grieve?

12
00:00:48,293 --> 00:00:50,128
This question is tricky.

13
00:00:50,505 --> 00:00:54,633
In 1871, Charles Darwin argued that other animals

14
00:00:54,634 --> 00:00:58,678
experience a wide range of emotions, including grief.

15
00:00:59,137 --> 00:01:03,183
But, especially in the absence of a dependable bridge

16
00:01:03,183 --> 00:01:05,518
between our minds and theirs,

17
00:01:05,602 --> 00:01:08,355
many scientists have long been wary

18
00:01:08,355 --> 00:01:12,067
of projecting human emotions onto other animals.

19
00:01:12,317 --> 00:01:17,321
It’s also been thought that they might display irregular behaviors after a death

20
00:01:17,322 --> 00:01:19,532
for other adaptive reasons.

21
00:01:19,784 --> 00:01:25,498
And, for a while, the paradigm was that humans were exceptional:

22
00:01:25,498 --> 00:01:28,501
other animals were reacting and surviving,

23
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:32,338
while we alone were thinking and feeling.

24
00:01:32,963 --> 00:01:37,634
This conception was increasingly challenged during the 20th century.

25
00:01:37,843 --> 00:01:41,762
In 1985, for example, a gorilla called Koko,

26
00:01:41,763 --> 00:01:45,891
who'd been trained to use some signs from American Sign Language,

27
00:01:45,893 --> 00:01:49,021
was told that her kitten companion had died.

28
00:01:49,063 --> 00:01:52,357
She made distress calls, and several weeks later,

29
00:01:52,358 --> 00:01:58,906
looking at a photo of another kitten signed “cry,” “sad,” and “frown.”

30
00:01:59,823 --> 00:02:03,785
Now there’s a growing pool of data and observations

31
00:02:03,786 --> 00:02:07,956
suggesting that some animals, including mammals and birds,

32
00:02:07,956 --> 00:02:11,375
might experience what we call grief.

33
00:02:12,252 --> 00:02:17,631
In 2003, Eleanor, an elephant matriarch, collapsed.

34
00:02:18,258 --> 00:02:23,847
Within minutes, another matriarch called Grace neared and helped Eleanor stand,

35
00:02:24,056 --> 00:02:26,266
only for her to fall again.

36
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:32,856
Grace vocalized, stayed by Eleanor’s side, and tried pushing her back up.

37
00:02:33,149 --> 00:02:37,320
When Eleanor died, a female named Maui approached,

38
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,449
positioned herself over Eleanor’s body, and rocked back and forth.

39
00:02:42,824 --> 00:02:44,868
Over the course of one week,

40
00:02:45,036 --> 00:02:49,457
elephants from five different families visited Eleanor’s body.

41
00:02:49,873 --> 00:02:51,750
On separate occasions,

42
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:55,879
elephants have been observed carrying the remains of family members,

43
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:58,548
including jawbones and tusks.

44
00:02:59,758 --> 00:03:05,347
In 2010, a giraffe was born with a deformed foot and had trouble walking.

45
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:08,224
The calf lived just four weeks.

46
00:03:08,391 --> 00:03:14,230
On the day the calf died, 22 other females and four juveniles

47
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:18,317
closely attended and occasionally nuzzled the body.

48
00:03:18,526 --> 00:03:23,405
On the third morning, the mother was alone and still not eating,

49
00:03:23,407 --> 00:03:26,369
which giraffes usually do constantly.

50
00:03:26,618 --> 00:03:33,332
Instead, she stayed by her dead calf, even after hyenas ate away at the body.

51
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,421
Scientists have also begun quantitatively assessing other animals’

52
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:39,923
responses to death.

53
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:46,847
In 2006, researchers analyzed baboon fecal samples for glucocorticoids,

54
00:03:46,973 --> 00:03:50,935
stress hormones that spike when humans are bereaved.

55
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,481
They compared the samples from females who had lost a close relative

56
00:03:55,522 --> 00:03:58,775
in a predator attack with those who hadn’t.

57
00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:03,571
And they found that the glucocorticoid levels of baboons who had

58
00:04:03,572 --> 00:04:07,326
were significantly higher the month following the death.

59
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:11,328
Those baboons then increased their grooming behavior

60
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,165
and the number of their grooming partners,

61
00:04:14,165 --> 00:04:17,419
broadening and strengthening their social networks.

62
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:22,799
Within two months, their glucocorticoid levels returned to the baseline.

63
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,304
Researchers have also observed primate mothers engaging in apparently

64
00:04:28,305 --> 00:04:32,183
contradictory behaviors while carrying their dead children.

65
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,354
Like switching between cannibalizing or dragging their child’s corpse

66
00:04:37,355 --> 00:04:40,024
and carefully carrying or grooming it,

67
00:04:40,276 --> 00:04:44,447
suggesting that the mothers were experiencing conflicting impulses

68
00:04:44,447 --> 00:04:45,989
towards the bodies.

69
00:04:47,074 --> 00:04:49,784
Our current understanding of the emotional landscapes

70
00:04:49,785 --> 00:04:52,579
of other animals is severely limited.

71
00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:56,334
To get a better grasp on mourning in the animal kingdom,

72
00:04:56,334 --> 00:04:59,044
we need a lot more research.

73
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,880
But where does this leave us for now?

74
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:08,136
Conversations around whether non-human animals experience emotions, like grief,

75
00:05:08,262 --> 00:05:10,347
can be emotional,

76
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,102
in part because their outcomes have very real implications—

77
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:19,690
like determining if orcas should be isolated and kept in captivity,

78
00:05:19,857 --> 00:05:24,278
or whether dairy cows should be separated from their newborn calves.

79
00:05:24,694 --> 00:05:27,781
Until we do have more data on the subject,

80
00:05:27,822 --> 00:05:33,286
should we treat non-human animals like they may have the capacity to grieve?

81
00:05:33,788 --> 00:05:36,122
Or assume they don’t?

82
00:05:36,665 --> 00:05:39,877
Which belief could cause more harm?
